2\. You may request for the termination of your policy by notifying
us in written notice. Also, we will terminate your policy and you /
the insured person will lose the cover when one of the following
happens:  
路 the insured person passes away;  
路 you do not pay the premium within 30 days after the
premium due date;  
路 the company has ceased to have the requisite authorization
under the Insurance Ordinance to write or continue to write
the plan; or  
路 when taking this plan as an add-on plan of any basic plan
which has been terminated. For continuation of the cover,
you may apply to convert this add-on plan to a stand-alone
plan by giving us a written notice.  
3\. We underwrite the plan and you are subject to our credit risk.
If we are unable to satisfy the financial obligations of the policy,
the insured person may lose his cover and you may lose the
remaining premium for that policy year.  
4\. You are subject to exchange rate risks for plans denominated
in currencies other than the local currency. Exchange rates
fluctuate from time to time. You may suffer a loss of your benefit
values and the subsequent premium payments (if any) may
be higher than your initial premium payment as a result of
exchange rate fluctuations. You should consider the exchange
rate risks and decide whether to take such risks.  
5\. The future medical costs will be higher than they are today
due to inflation. Hence, the benefit amounts and the future
premium rate of this plan may be revised to reflect the inflation.
