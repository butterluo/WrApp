With quality medical protection as your safety net, you can chase your dreams with confidence. Supplemental cover for major medical benefits. . 

On top of the maximum benefits for confinement, surgery
and other medical benefits, AIA Voluntary Health Insurance
Flexi Scheme offers you extra support through supplemental
major medical benefits (SMM). The benefit limits of SMM will
reset each policy year. It will also reset if you receive specified
medical services (confinement, day case procedure and
day case prescribed diagnostic imaging tests) for different
sicknesses or injuries. That way, you can have extra peace of
mind in the face of multiple medical challenges.  
Within the same policy year, if you receive a specified
medical service for the same disability again 90 days after
you received a specified medical service, SMM benefit limits
will also reset.
