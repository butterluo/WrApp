With quality medical protection as your safety net, you can chase your dreams with confidence. Cover on unknown pre-existing conditions. . 

At present, pre-existing conditions unknown to insurance
applicants are commonly excluded from benefit cover. However,
you can trust in your protection under AIA Voluntary Health
Insurance Flexi Scheme even if you turn out to have a pre-existing
condition that you were reasonably unaware of at the time
of insurance application. This plan provides full cover starting
from the 31st day of the 1st policy year, which is shorter than
the minimum requirement of 3-year waiting period under VHIS.
