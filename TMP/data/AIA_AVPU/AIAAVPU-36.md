1\. We only cover the charges and / or expenses of the insured person
on medically necessary and reasonable and customary basis.  
"Medically necessary" means the need to have medical service
for the purpose of investigating or treating the relevant disability
in accordance with the generally accepted standards of medical
practice and such medical service must:  
· require the expertise of, or be referred by, a registered medical
practitioner;  
· be consistent with the diagnosis and necessary for the investigation
and treatment of the disability;  
· be rendered in accordance with standards of good and prudent
medical practice, and not be rendered primarily for the convenience
or the comfort of the insured person, his family, caretaker or the
attending registered medical practitioner;  
· be rendered in the setting that is most appropriate in the
circumstances and in accordance with the generally accepted
standards of medical practice for the medical services; and  
· be furnished at the most appropriate level which, in the prudent
professional judgment of the attending registered medical
practitioner, can be safely and effectively provided to the insured
person.  
"Reasonable and customary" means in relation to a charge for
medical service, such level which does not exceed the general range
of charges being charged by the relevant service providers in the
locality where the charge is incurred for similar treatment, services
or supplies to individuals with similar conditions, e.g. of the same sex
and similar age, for a similar disability, as reasonably determined by
the Company in utmost good faith. The reasonable and customary
charges shall not in any event exceed the actual charges incurred.  
In determining whether a charge is reasonable and customary, we
shall make reference to the followings (if applicable):  
· treatment or service fee statistics and surveys in the insurance or
medical industry;  
· internal or industry claim statistics;  
· gazette published by the government; and / or

4\. Semi-Private Room means a single or double occupancy room, with

with adjoining bathroom in a hospital. For the avoidance of doubt,
Standard Private Room does not include any room with amenities
upgraded beyond a basic single occupancy room with adjoining
bathroom in a hospital.  
6\. Hospitals offer various accommodation options with different
facilities, and the categorisation used by the hospitals may be
different from the definitions stated in this brochure. If you are
unsure of whether a particular accommodation option meets the
Semi-Private Room and Standard Private Room definitions under
the policy, please contact the Company before confinement.  
7\. The insured person will be covered for any room type in which he
stays at hospital, but there will be a reduction in his benefit pay-out
amount in case the insured person stays in a room type higher than
the plan covers. In such a case, the benefit pay-out amount will be
adjusted by multiplying the following factor:  
Highest daily room charge of the covered room type
in the hospital admitted by the insured person
(depends on which country / place the insured person stays)  
=
Actual daily room charge of the room the insured person stays  
Except when such confinement in a room of class above covered
room is due to:  
. unavailability of covered room for emergency treatment as a result
of capacity shortfall in the hospital of confinement;  
· isolation reasons that require a specific class of accommodation;
or  
· other reasons not involving personal preference of you and / or the
insured person.
