With quality medical protection as your safety net, you can chase your dreams with confidence. No claim discount. . 

AIA believes in maintaining healthy living habits, and we
encourage you to maintain yours by rewarding you with a no
claim discount on premium, up to 15% of the total premium
paid for the preceding policy year. Being our loyal customer
(i.e. the policy of this plan has been effective for 30 years
and the insured person is aged 65 or above), the relevant
discount can be up to 25%.  
If no claim is made for 3 consecutive policy years or more,
you will be eligible for this premium discount on the next
policy anniversary. Please refer to the following table for no
claim discount.

network clinics and day case procedure centre, made a claim
for top-up subsidy benefit, or used Personal Medical Case
Management Services and worldwide emergency assistance
services (see benefit schedule, benefit items II (c), (h) and
(i) for details), your eligibility for this premium discount will
not be affected.
