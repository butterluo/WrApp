However, these methods\\ntypically focus solely on adapting VLMs from a single modality and fail to\\naccumulate task-specific knowledge as more samples are processed. To address\\nthis, we introduce Dual Prototype Evolving (DPE), a novel test-time adaptation\\napproach for VLMs that effectively accumulates task-specific knowledge from\\nmulti-modalities. Specifically, we create and evolve two sets of\\nprototypes--textual and visual--to progressively capture more accurate\\nmulti-modal representations for target classes during test time. Moreover, to\\npromote consistent multi-modal representations, we introduce and optimize\\nlearnable residuals for each test sample to align the prototypes from both\\nmodalities. Extensive experimental results on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate\\nthat our proposed DPE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art\\nmethods while also exhibiting competitive computational efficiency.

This paper introduces the concept of Meta-Chunking, which refers to a\\ngranularity between sentences and paragraphs, consisting of a collection of\\nsentences within a paragraph that have deep linguistic logical connections. To\\nimplement Meta-Chunking, we designed two strategies based on LLMs: Margin\\nSampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The former employs LLMs to perform\\nbinary classification on whether consecutive sentences need to be segmented,\\nmaking decisions based on the probability difference obtained from margin\\nsampling. The latter precisely identifies text chunk boundaries by analyzing\\nthe characteristics of perplexity distribution. Additionally, considering the\\ninherent complexity of different texts, we propose a strategy that combines\\nMeta-Chunking with dynamic merging to achieve a balance between fine-grained\\nand coarse-grained text chunking. Experiments conducted on eleven datasets\\ndemonstrate that Meta-Chunking can more efficiently improve the performance of\\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question answering based on RAG. For instance, on the\\n2WikiMultihopQA dataset, it outperforms similarity chunking by 1.32 while only\\nconsuming 45.8% of the time. Our code is available at\\nhttps://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/Meta-Chunking. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12788v1) |\\n| The Curse of Multi-Modalities: Evaluating Hallucinations of Large\\n  Multimodal Models across Language, Visual, and Audio | Lidong Bing | General | Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly\\nenhanced performance across diverse tasks, with ongoing efforts to further\\nintegrate additional modalities such as video and audio. However, most existing\\nLMMs remain vulnerable to hallucinations, the discrepancy between the factual\\nmultimodal input and the generated textual output, which has limited their\\napplicability in various real-world scenarios. This paper presents the first\\nsystematic investigation of hallucinations in LMMs involving the three most\\ncommon modalities: language, visual, and audio. Our study reveals two key\\ncontributors to hallucinations: overreliance on unimodal priors and spurious\\ninter-modality correlations. To address these challenges, we introduce the\\nbenchmark The Curse of Multi-Modalities (CMM), which comprehensively evaluates\\nhallucinations in LMMs, providing a detailed analysis of their underlying\\nissues. Our findings highlight key vulnerabilities, including imbalances in\\nmodality integration and biases from training data, underscoring the need for\\nbalanced cross-modal learning and enhanced hallucination mitigation strategies.\\nBased on our observations and findings, we suggest potential research\\ndirections that could enhance the reliability of LMMs. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12787v1) |\\n| JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges | Ion Stoica | General | LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation\\nand are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the\\nreliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs\\nbecome more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring\\nstronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a\\njudge\\'s alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more\\nchallenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of\\nfactual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation\\nframework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we\\npropose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging\\nresponse pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench\\nleverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into\\nchallenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective\\ncorrectness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges,\\nfine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench\\nposes a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many\\nstrong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random\\nguessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing\\nincreasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

However, leveraging the ICL\\ncapabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely\\nunexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables\\noff-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL\\nwithout training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that\\ncapture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector\\nactions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and\\nboth are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a\\nstructured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions\\nand a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions\\nat test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows\\nstronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and\\nreal-world settings. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12782v1) |\\n| Measuring time-resolved heat transfer fluctuations on a heated-thin foil\\n  in a turbulent channel airflow | Andrea Ianiro | General | We present an experimental setup to perform time-resolved convective heat\\ntransfer measurements in a turbulent channel flow with air as the working\\nfluid.

Ulissi | General | The ability to discover new materials with desirable properties is critical\\nfor numerous applications from helping mitigate climate change to advances in\\nnext generation computing hardware. AI has the potential to accelerate\\nmaterials discovery and design by more effectively exploring the chemical space\\ncompared to other computational methods or by trial-and-error. While\\nsubstantial progress has been made on AI for materials data, benchmarks, and\\nmodels, a barrier that has emerged is the lack of publicly available training\\ndata and open pre-trained models. To address this, we present a Meta FAIR\\nrelease of the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) large-scale open dataset and an\\naccompanying set of pre-trained models. OMat24 contains over 110 million\\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations focused on structural and\\ncompositional diversity.

In this context, we compare Leja and Krylov based methods to\\ncompute the action of exponential and related matrix functions. We set up a\\nperformance model by counting the different operations needed to implement the\\nconsidered algorithms. This model assumes that the evaluation of the right-hand\\nside is memory bound and allows us to evaluate performance in a hardware\\nindependent way. We find that exponential integrators perform comparably to\\nexplicit Runge-Kutta schemes for problems that are advection dominated in the\\nentire domain. Moreover, they are able to outperform explicit methods in\\nsituations where small parts of the domain are diffusion dominated. We\\ngenerally observe that Leja based methods outperform Krylov iterations in the\\nproblems considered. This is in particular true if computing inner products is\\nexpensive. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12765v1) |\\n| Gravity-aligned Rotation Averaging with Circular Regression | Dániel Baráth | General | Reconstructing a 3D scene from unordered images is pivotal in computer vision\\nand robotics, with applications spanning crowd-sourced mapping and beyond.\\nWhile global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques are scalable and fast, they\\noften compromise on accuracy. To address this, we introduce a principled\\napproach that integrates gravity direction into the rotation averaging phase of\\nglobal pipelines, enhancing camera orientation accuracy and reducing the\\ndegrees of freedom. This additional information is commonly available in recent\\nconsumer devices, such as smartphones, mixed-reality devices and drones, making\\nthe proposed method readily accessible. Rooted in circular regression, our\\nalgorithm has similar convergence guarantees as linear regression. It also\\nsupports scenarios where only a subset of cameras have known gravity.\\nAdditionally, we propose a mechanism to refine error-prone gravity. We achieve\\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets. Particularly, the\\nproposed method improves upon the SfM baseline by 13 AUC@$1^\\\\circ$ points, on\\naverage, while running eight times faster. It also outperforms the standard\\nplanar pose graph optimization technique by 23 AUC@$1^\\\\circ$ points.

Wang | General | Recent developments in adversarial attacks on deep learning leave many\\nmission-critical natural language processing (NLP) systems at risk of\\nexploitation. To address the lack of computationally efficient adversarial\\ndefense methods, this paper reports a novel, universal technique that\\ndrastically improves the robustness of Bidirectional Encoder Representations\\nfrom Transformers (BERT) by combining the unitary weights with the multi-margin\\nloss. We discover that the marriage of these two simple ideas amplifies the\\nprotection against malicious interference. Our model, the unitary multi-margin\\nBERT (UniBERT), boosts post-attack classification accuracies significantly by\\n5.3% to 73.8% while maintaining competitive pre-attack accuracies. Furthermore,\\nthe pre-attack and post-attack accuracy tradeoff can be adjusted via a single\\nscalar parameter to best fit the design requirements for the target\\napplications. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12759v1) |\\n| StyleDistance: Stronger Content-Independent Style Embeddings with\\n  Synthetic Parallel Examples | Chris Callison-Burch | General | Style representations aim to embed texts with similar writing styles closely\\nand texts with different styles far apart, regardless of content. However, the\\ncontrastive triplets often used for training these representations may vary in\\nboth style and content, leading to potential content leakage in the\\nrepresentations. We introduce StyleDistance, a novel approach to training\\nstronger content-independent style embeddings. We use a large language model to\\ncreate a synthetic dataset of near-exact paraphrases with controlled style\\nvariations, and produce positive and negative examples across 40 distinct style\\nfeatures for precise contrastive learning. We assess the quality of our\\nsynthetic data and embeddings through human and automatic evaluations.\\nStyleDistance enhances the content-independence of style embeddings, which\\ngeneralize to real-world benchmarks and outperform leading style\\nrepresentations in downstream applications.

These currents arise due\\nto several phenomena such as asymmetries, imperfections in the winding layout,\\nand differences in electric potential between the parallel conductors. This\\neffect is visible typically in windings of transformers, motors, or generators.\\nAt on-load condition, this is equivalent to having a current unevenly\\ndistributed between parallel conductors. Circulating currents have two main\\ndrawbacks: increased losses in windings and potential degradation of insulation\\nover time. The former is an intuitive property that is widely acknowledged in\\nthe literature. This paper presents a formal proof of this fundamental\\nproperty, building upon the authors\\' previous work and embedding it within a\\nrigorous mathematical framework. The mathematical definition of circulating\\ncurrents is provided, along with a case application in an electric machine. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12748v1) |\\n| DRIP: A Versatile Family of Space-Time ISAC Waveforms | Marwa Chafii | General | The following paper introduces Dual beam-similarity awaRe Integrated sensing\\nand communications (ISAC) with controlled Peak-to-average power ratio (DRIP)\\nwaveforms. DRIP is a novel family of space-time ISAC waveforms designed for\\ndynamic peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) adjustment. The proposed DRIP\\nwaveforms are designed to conform to specified PAPR levels while exhibiting\\nbeampattern properties, effectively targeting multiple desired directions and\\nsuppressing interference for multi-target sensing applications, while closely\\nresembling radar chirps. For communication purposes, the proposed DRIP\\nwaveforms aim to minimize multi-user interference across various\\nconstellations. Addressing the non-convexity of the optimization framework\\nrequired for generating DRIP waveforms, we introduce a block cyclic coordinate\\ndescent algorithm. This iterative approach ensures convergence to an optimal\\nISAC waveform solution. Simulation results validate the DRIP waveforms\\'\\nsuperior performance, versatility, and favorable ISAC trade-offs, highlighting\\ntheir potential in advanced multi-target sensing and communication systems. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12746v1) |\\n| Analytical Study of Surface Plasmon-Phonon Polaritons in\\n  Nonlinear-Graphene-LiF Heterostructures in the far-infrared region | Sina Asgari | General | In this paper, a new heterostructure based on the hybridization of\\ngraphene-LiF layers with a nonlinear material is introduced and studied.

For this article,\\nwe utilize the number of such claims to estimate the number of years expected\\nbefore the occurrence of a Catastrophic Disclosure, a term which was defined at\\nthe 2023 Sol Foundation\\'s inaugural conference as the accidental disclosure of\\nconclusive evidence of the existence of NHI, outside of the control of human\\ninstitutions, such as governments and militaries. Here, we will consider one\\npossible example of this as the crash of a piloted spacecraft (or, an ET probe)\\nin the middle of a busy metropolis. The distribution of humans on Earth\\'s\\nsurface, the population as a function of time, and the fraction of individuals\\nowning smartphones, also versus time, are each taken into account as\\nfoundations for a rigorous statistical analysis. The author adopts a skeptical\\napproach and doesn\\'t claim NHI or ET are real but uses their analysis as an\\neducational example of critical thinking and application of standard\\nstatistical distributions to an issue which captures the imagination of the\\npublic like almost no other issue. Making the extraordinary assumptions that\\nsentient species other than humans exist, are capable of constructing vehicles\\nfor transportation, and are sufficiently fallible that their technology can\\nmalfunction, it is possible to quantify potential answers to the question of\\nhow long it will be before smartphone imagery or video proofs appear on the\\ninternet and become irrevocable through classification in the modern era. The\\nresults of simulations of numerous different potential scenarios, of varying\\ndegrees of pessimism/optimism, indicate that, if NHI/ETs is/are real,\\ncatastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the\\nmean expected year being 2040+/-20 under the default assumptions. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12738v1) |\\n| CREAM: Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Models | Huaxiu Yao | General | Recent self-rewarding large language models (LLM) have successfully applied\\nLLM-as-a-Judge to iteratively improve the alignment performance without the\\nneed of human annotations for preference data. These methods commonly utilize\\nthe same LLM to act as both the policy model (which generates responses) and\\nthe reward model (which scores and ranks those responses). The ranked responses\\nare then used as preference pairs to train the LLM via direct alignment\\ntechnologies (e.g. DPO). However, it is noteworthy that throughout this\\nprocess, there is no guarantee of accuracy in the rewarding and ranking, which\\nis critical for ensuring accurate rewards and high-quality preference data.\\nEmpirical results from relatively small LLMs (e.g., 7B parameters) also\\nindicate that improvements from self-rewarding may diminish after several\\niterations in certain situations, which we hypothesize is due to accumulated\\nbias in the reward system. This bias can lead to unreliable preference data for\\ntraining the LLM. To address this issue, we first formulate and analyze the\\ngeneralized iterative preference fine-tuning framework for self-rewarding\\nlanguage model. We then introduce the regularization to this generalized\\nframework to mitigate the overconfident preference labeling in the\\nself-rewarding process. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose a\\nConsistency Regularized sElf-rewarding lAnguage Model (CREAM) that leverages\\nthe rewarding consistency across different iterations to regularize the\\nself-rewarding training, helping the model to learn from more reliable\\npreference data. With this explicit regularization, our empirical results\\ndemonstrate the superiority of CREAM in improving both reward consistency and\\nalignment performance.

One such problem is the accurate simulation of\\nhighly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the\\nproblem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately\\npredict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are\\npresent. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only\\nallows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time\\na quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is\\nan important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes\\nsuch as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key\\ncomponent in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the\\nmechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum\\neigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods\\nis used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity\\nmodel (AIM).

It allows a variety of\\nchanges to the environment to generate the counterfactual, including\\nmodifications of the utility functions, the distribution of utility\\ndeterminants, the number of decision makers, and the solution concept. We use a\\nBayesian approach to summarize statistical uncertainty. We establish conditions\\nunder which the population CPDS is sharp from the point of view of\\nidentification. We also establish conditions under which the posterior CPDS is\\nconsistent if the posterior distribution for the underlying model parameter is\\nconsistent. Consequently, our results can be employed to conduct counterfactual\\nanalysis after a preliminary step of identifying and estimating the underlying\\nmodel parameter based on the existing literature.

This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via\\ndiscrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect\\non SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin\\ndisorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is\\nseen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that\\nmaximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are\\nimpervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state.\\nFurther, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for\\nphase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and\\ndistorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin\\ndisorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder,\\nirrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE\\ncan be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths\\nat specific time steps.

Specifically, we design a\\ndiffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically\\napproximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more\\nflexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the\\nvalue encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a\\ntext-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image,\\nvalue principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through\\nadaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces\\nharmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong\\nbaselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12700v1) |\\n| VividMed: Vision Language Model with Versatile Visual Grounding for\\n  Medicine | Ting Chen | General | Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated\\nremarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their\\napplication in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For\\ninstance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas\\ncomplex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while\\nmost VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The\\nlack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these\\nchallenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual\\ngrounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic\\nsegmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various\\nimaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage\\ntraining procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open\\ndatasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in\\nother common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and\\nreport generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of\\nvisual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks. Our code\\nis publicly available at https://github.com/function2-llx/MMMM. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12694v1) |\\n| Machine Learning Approach to Brain Tumor Detection and Classification | Soo Min Oh | General | Brain tumor detection and classification are critical tasks in medical image\\nanalysis, particularly in early-stage diagnosis, where accurate and timely\\ndetection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this study, we apply\\nvarious statistical and machine learning models to detect and classify brain\\ntumors using brain MRI images. We explore a variety of statistical models\\nincluding linear, logistic, and Bayesian regressions, and the machine learning\\nmodels including decision tree, random forest, single-layer perceptron,\\nmulti-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural\\nnetwork, and long short-term memory. Our findings show that CNN outperforms\\nother models, achieving the best performance. Additionally, we confirm that the\\nCNN model can also work for multi-class classification, distinguishing between\\nfour categories of brain MRI images such as normal, glioma, meningioma, and\\npituitary tumor images. This study demonstrates that machine learning\\napproaches are suitable for brain tumor detection and classification,\\nfacilitating real-world medical applications in assisting radiologists with\\nearly and accurate diagnosis. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12692v1) |\\n| Local transfer learning Gaussian process modeling, with applications to\\n  surrogate modeling of expensive computer simulators | Jianguo Wu | General | A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of\\ncomputer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing\\nsolution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to\\nemulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored\\ninputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems.\\nFor example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on\\nturbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from\\nsuch \"source\" systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on\\nthe \"target\" system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning\\nGaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian\\nprocess to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of\\nthe LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where\\ntransfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. This\\n\"local transfer\" property is desirable in scientific systems: at certain\\nparameters, such systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial;\\nat other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is\\ndetrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can rectify a\\ncritical limitation of \"negative transfer\" in existing transfer learning\\nmodels, where the transfer of information worsens predictive performance. We\\nderive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling\\non the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings.\\nWe then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet\\nturbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing\\nmethods. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12690v1) |\\n| Automatic Mapping of Anatomical Landmarks from Free-Text Using Large\\n  Language Models: Insights from Llama-2 | Halid Ziya Yerebakan | General | Anatomical landmarks are vital in medical imaging for navigation and anomaly\\ndetection. Modern large language models (LLMs), like Llama-2, offer promise for\\nautomating the mapping of these landmarks in free-text radiology reports to\\ncorresponding positions in image data. Recent studies propose LLMs may develop\\ncoherent representations of generative processes. Motivated by these insights,\\nwe investigated whether LLMs accurately represent the spatial positions of\\nanatomical landmarks. Through experiments with Llama-2 models, we found that\\nthey can linearly represent anatomical landmarks in space with considerable\\nrobustness to different prompts. These results underscore the potential of LLMs\\nto enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical imaging workflows. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12686v1) |\\n| Physics-Informed Learning for the Friction Modeling of High-Ratio\\n  Harmonic Drives | Daniele Pucci | General | This paper presents a scalable method for friction identification in robots\\nequipped with electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives, utilizing\\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). This approach eliminates the need for\\ndedicated setups and joint torque sensors by leveraging the robo\\\\v{t}s\\nintrinsic model and state data. We present a comprehensive pipeline that\\nincludes data acquisition, preprocessing, ground truth generation, and model\\nidentification. The effectiveness of the PINN-based friction identification is\\nvalidated through extensive testing on two different joints of the humanoid\\nrobot ergoCub, comparing its performance against traditional static friction\\nmodels like the Coulomb-viscous and Stribeck-Coulomb-viscous models.\\nIntegrating the identified PINN-based friction models into a two-layer torque\\ncontrol architecture enhances real-time friction compensation. The results\\ndemonstrate significant improvements in control performance and reductions in\\nenergy losses, highlighting the scalability and robustness of the proposed\\nmethod, also for application across a large number of joints as in the case of\\nhumanoid robots. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12685v1) |\\n| Best-Worst Disaggregation: An approach to the preference disaggregation\\n  problem | Jafar Rezaei | General | Preference disaggregation methods in Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)\\noften encounter challenges related to inconsistency and cognitive biases when\\nderiving a value function from experts\\' holistic preferences. This paper\\nintroduces the Best-Worst Disaggregation (BWD) method, a novel approach that\\nintegrates the principles of the Best-Worst Method (BWM) into the\\ndisaggregation framework to enhance the consistency and reliability of derived\\npreference models. BWD employs the \"consider-the-opposite\" strategy from BWM,\\nallowing experts to provide two opposite pairwise comparison vectors of\\nalternatives. This approach reduces cognitive load and mitigates anchoring\\nbias, possibly leading to more reliable criteria weights and attribute value\\nfunctions. An optimization model is formulated to determine the most suitable\\nadditive value function to the preferences expressed by an expert. The method\\nalso incorporates a consistency analysis to quantify and improve the\\nreliability of the judgments. Additionally, BWD is extended to handle\\ninterval-valued preferences, enhancing its applicability in situations with\\nuncertainty or imprecise information. We also developed an approach to identify\\na reference set, which is used for pairwise comparisons to elicit the value\\nfunctions and weights. A case study in logistics performance evaluation\\ndemonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of BWD, showing that it\\nproduces reliable rankings aligned closely with experts\\' preferences. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12678v1) |\\n| Hamiltonian bridge: A physics-driven generative framework for targeted\\n  pattern control | L. Mahadevan | General | Patterns arise spontaneously in a range of systems spanning the sciences, and\\ntheir study typically focuses on mechanisms to understand their evolution in\\nspace-time. Increasingly, there has been a transition towards controlling these\\npatterns in various functional settings, with implications for engineering.\\nHere, we combine our knowledge of a general class of dynamical laws for pattern\\nformation in non-equilibrium systems, and the power of stochastic optimal\\ncontrol approaches to present a framework that allows us to control patterns at\\nmultiple scales, which we dub the \"Hamiltonian bridge\". We use a mapping\\nbetween stochastic many-body Lagrangian physics and deterministic Eulerian\\npattern forming PDEs to leverage our recent approach utilizing the\\nFeynman-Kac-based adjoint path integral formulation for the control of\\ninteracting particles and generalize this to the active control of patterning\\nfields. We demonstrate the applicability of our computational framework via\\nnumerical experiments on the control of phase separation with and without a\\nconserved order parameter, self-assembly of fluid droplets, coupled\\nreaction-diffusion equations and finally a phenomenological model for\\nspatio-temporal tissue differentiation. We interpret our numerical experiments\\nin terms of a theoretical understanding of how the underlying physics shapes\\nthe geometry of the pattern manifold, altering the transport paths of patterns\\nand the nature of pattern interpolation. We finally conclude by showing how\\noptimal control can be utilized to generate complex patterns via an iterative\\ncontrol protocol over pattern forming pdes which can be casted as gradient\\nflows. All together, our study shows how we can systematically build in\\nphysical priors into a generative framework for pattern control in\\nnon-equilibrium systems across multiple length and time scales. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12665v1) |\\n| Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models | Xueqi Cheng | General | Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\\nsuccessfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that\\nexisting vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety\\nmechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic\\nimage. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation\\nof where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative\\nanalysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the\\nspecific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of\\nsafety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in\\ncurrent methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input\\nimages compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety\\nmechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language\\nAlignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input\\nvision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states\\nspace in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the\\nsafety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment\\nfor LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also\\nmaintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good). | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12662v1) |\\n| Simulation of Quantum Computers: Review and Acceleration Opportunities | Pedro Trancoso | General | Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by\\nsolving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current\\nclassical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is\\nstill in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited\\nresources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test\\nquantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In\\naddition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also\\ndepends on simulations.\\n  Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very\\ndemanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such,\\nsimulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different\\noptimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different\\nlevels.\\n  This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the\\nlevels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be\\nsimulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration\\napproaches.

However, their\\nlinguistic generalization capabilities remain questionable, raising doubts\\nabout whether these models learn language similarly to humans. While humans\\nexhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use,\\nthe extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology,\\nis under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the\\nmorphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of\\ncompositionality. We define morphemes as compositional primitives and design a\\nnovel suite of generative and discriminative tasks to assess morphological\\nproductivity and systematicity. Focusing on agglutinative languages such as\\nTurkish and Finnish, we evaluate several state-of-the-art instruction-finetuned\\nmultilingual models, including GPT-4 and Gemini. Our analysis shows that LLMs\\nstruggle with morphological compositional generalization particularly when\\napplied to novel word roots, with performance declining sharply as\\nmorphological complexity increases. While models can identify individual\\nmorphological combinations better than chance, their performance lacks\\nsystematicity, leading to significant accuracy gaps compared to humans. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12656v1) |\\n| Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard\\n  Constraints | Sandeep P. Chinchali | General | Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models\\nand protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and\\nsafety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints\\nthat are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider,\\nfor example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak\\ndemand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids\\nduring adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating\\nconstrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To\\naddress these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a\\ndiffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean\\nestimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS\\nscales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional\\ntraining. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our\\nprojection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art\\nmethods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and\\n42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v1) |\\n| Towards Designing Scalable Quantum-Enhanced Generative Networks for\\n  Neutrino Physics Experiments with Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers | Kevon Carroll | General | Generative modeling for high-resolution images in Liquid Argon Time\\nProjection Chambers (LArTPC), used in neutrino physics experiments, presents\\nsignificant challenges due to the complexity and sparsity of the data. This\\nwork explores the application of quantum-enhanced generative networks to\\naddress these challenges, focusing on the scaling of models to handle larger\\nimage sizes and avoid the often encountered problem of mode collapse. To\\ncounteract mode collapse, regularization methods were introduced and proved to\\nbe successful on small-scale images, demonstrating improvements in stabilizing\\nthe training process.

Finding these polytopes enables the\\napplication of stronger motion-planning frameworks such as trajectory\\noptimization with Graphs of Convex Sets [1] and is currently a major roadblock\\nin the adoption of these approaches. In this paper, we build upon IRIS-NP\\n(Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite & Nonlinear Programming) [2] to\\nsignificantly improve tunability, runtimes, and scaling to complex\\nenvironments. IRIS-NP uses nonlinear programming paired with uniform random\\ninitialization to find configurations on the boundary of the free configuration\\nspace. Our key insight is that finding near-by configuration-space obstacles\\nusing sampling is inexpensive and greatly accelerates region generation. We\\npropose two algorithms using such samples to either employ nonlinear\\nprogramming more efficiently (IRIS-NP2 ) or circumvent it altogether using a\\nmassively-parallel zero-order optimization strategy (IRIS-ZO). We also propose\\na termination condition that controls the probability of exceeding a\\nuser-specified permissible fraction-in-collision, eliminating a significant\\nsource of tuning difficulty in IRIS-NP. We compare performance across eight\\nrobot environments, showing that IRIS-ZO achieves an order-of-magnitude speed\\nadvantage over IRIS-NP.

For many kernel\\nfunctions, such as Gaussian and Laplacian kernels, the feature space is known\\nto be infinite-dimensional, making operations in this space possible only\\nimplicitly. This implicit nature necessitates algorithms to be expressed using\\ndual representations and the kernel trick. In this paper, given an arbitrary\\nkernel function, we introduce an explicit, finite-dimensional feature map for\\nany arbitrary kernel function that ensures the inner product of data points in\\nthe feature space equals the kernel function value, during both training and\\ntesting. The existence of this explicit mapping allows for kernelized\\nalgorithms to be formulated in their primal form, without the need for the\\nkernel trick or the dual representation. As a first application, we demonstrate\\nhow to derive kernelized machine learning algorithms directly, without\\nresorting to the dual representation, and apply this method specifically to\\nPCA. As another application, without any changes to the t-SNE algorithm and its\\nimplementation, we use it for visualizing the feature space of kernel\\nfunctions. | 2024-10-16 | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12635v1) |\\n| Non-perturbative thermal QCD at very high temperatures | Pietro Rescigno | General | We present a recently introduced strategy to study non-perturbatively thermal\\nQCD up to temperatures of the order of the electro-weak scale, combining step\\nscaling techniques and shifted boundary conditions.

Traditional alignment methods\\nheavily rely on human feedback to fine-tune models. With the emergence of\\nsuperhuman models whose outputs may surpass human understanding, evaluating and\\naligning these models using human judgments poses significant challenges. To\\naddress the challenges, recent works use weak supervisors to elicit knowledge\\nfrom much stronger models. However, there are important disanalogies between\\nthe empirical setup in the existing works and the genuine goal of alignment. We\\nremark that existing works investigate the phenomenon of weak-to-strong\\ngeneration in analogous setup (i.e., binary classification), rather than\\npractical alignment-relevant tasks (e.g., safety). In this paper, we bridge\\nthis gap by extending weak-to-strong generation to the context of practical\\nalignment. We empirically demonstrate the widespread phenomenon of\\nweak-to-strong generation in three complicated alignment tasks: safety,\\ntoxicity, and legal reasoning}. Furthermore, we explore efficient strategies\\nfor improving alignment performance to enhance the quality of model outcomes.\\nLastly, we summarize and analyze the challenges and potential solutions in\\nregard to specific alignment tasks, which we hope to catalyze the research\\nprogress on the topic of weak-to-strong generalization.
