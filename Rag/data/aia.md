## Protect your whole family and apply for a higher tax deduction amount

To help you budget smarter, the premiums you pay for
AIA Voluntary Health Insurance Flexi Scheme is eligible
to be deducted from your annual taxable income. Taxpayer
who is the policyholder can apply for a tax deduction of up
to HKD8,000 per insured person, which the insured person
of the Certified Plan should be the taxpayer himself or any
specified relatives*, in each assessment year.

There is no cap on the number of specified relatives* that
a taxpayer can use to claim tax deductions as long as all the
policies are held by the same taxpayer and cover yourself
and / or your specified relatives \*. Specified relatives\* include
your spouse or child, or a parent, grandparent or sibling of
you or your spouse.

In other words, if you take up AIA Voluntary Health Insurance
Flexi Scheme for yourself, your spouse, your son and your
mother as an example (i.e. four insured persons) and pay
the required premiums in the same taxable year, the annual
tax deduction amount for you would be up to HKD32,000
(i.e. HKD8,000 x 4).

The illustration below shows the tax deduction amount you
could claim if you were the policyholder for four insured
persons, for example.

## Lifetime guaranteed renewal

AIA Voluntary Health Insurance Flexi Scheme provides
cover immediately right after the policy becomes effective
and guarantees that your premium for renewal will not be
raised for any claim you have made, or any changes in your
health condition. You can renew your cover every year for life.
Renewal premium will be based on the prevailing premium
rates at the time of renewal. (For details on the first year's
premium, please refer to the Standard Premium Schedule
provided by your financial planner, or available online
through www.aia.com.hk and www.vhis.gov.hk.)

## Steadfast protection with no annual benefit limit or lifetime benefit limit

AIA Voluntary Health Insurance Flexi Scheme stays with you
through the ups and downs of life. There is no annual benefit
limit or lifetime benefit limit, so you can get the treatment you
need, without worrying about losing your protection in the future.


<figure>
</figure>


## Cover on unknown pre-existing conditions

At present, pre-existing conditions unknown to insurance
applicants are commonly excluded from benefit cover. However,
you can trust in your protection under AIA Voluntary Health
Insurance Flexi Scheme even if you turn out to have a pre-existing
condition that you were reasonably unaware of at the time
of insurance application. This plan provides full cover starting
from the 31st day of the 1st policy year, which is shorter than
the minimum requirement of 3-year waiting period under VHIS.

## Supplemental cover for major medical benefits

On top of the maximum benefits for confinement, surgery
and other medical benefits, AIA Voluntary Health Insurance
Flexi Scheme offers you extra support through supplemental
major medical benefits (SMM). The benefit limits of SMM will
reset each policy year. It will also reset if you receive specified
medical services (confinement, day case procedure and
day case prescribed diagnostic imaging tests) for different
sicknesses or injuries. That way, you can have extra peace of
mind in the face of multiple medical challenges.

Within the same policy year, if you receive a specified
medical service for the same disability again 90 days after
you received a specified medical service, SMM benefit limits
will also reset.


<figure>
</figure>


## No claim discount

AIA believes in maintaining healthy living habits, and we
encourage you to maintain yours by rewarding you with a no
claim discount on premium, up to 15% of the total premium
paid for the preceding policy year. Being our loyal customer
(i.e. the policy of this plan has been effective for 30 years
and the insured person is aged 65 or above), the relevant
discount can be up to 25%.

If no claim is made for 3 consecutive policy years or more,
you will be eligible for this premium discount on the next
policy anniversary. Please refer to the following table for no
claim discount.


<table>
<tr>
<th>Claims Free Years</th>
<th>No Claim Discount</th>

<tr>
<td>3 consecutive policy years</td>

<tr>
<td>5 or more consecutive policy years</td>
<td>15%</td>

</tr>
</table>


Even if you received a day case procedure at any of our
network clinics and day case procedure centre, made a claim
for top-up subsidy benefit, or used Personal Medical Case
Management Services and worldwide emergency assistance
services (see benefit schedule, benefit items II (c), (h) and
(i) for details), your eligibility for this premium discount will
not be affected.

# Important Information

This brochure does not contain the full terms and conditions of the
policy. It is not, and does not form part of, a contract of insurance
and is designed to provide an overview of the key features of this
product. The precise terms and conditions of this plan are specified
in the policy contract. Please refer to the policy contract for the
definitions of capitalised terms, and the exact and complete terms
and conditions of cover. In case you want to read policy contract
sample before making an application, you can obtain a copy from
AIA. This brochure should be read along with the illustrative
document (if any) and other relevant marketing materials, which
include additional information and important considerations
about this product. We would like to remind you to review the
relevant product materials provided to you and seek independent
professional advice if necessary.

This plan is an insurance plan without any savings element. All
premiums are paid for the insurance and related costs.

This brochure is for distribution in Hong Kong only.


## Key Product Risks

1\. You need to pay the premium for this plan for life as long as you
renew for this plan. If you do not pay the premium within 30
days of the premium due date, the policy will be terminated and
you / the insured person will lose the cover.

2\. You may request for the termination of your policy by notifying
us in written notice. Also, we will terminate your policy and you /
the insured person will lose the cover when one of the following
happens:

· the insured person passes away;

· you do not pay the premium within 30 days after the
premium due date;

· the company has ceased to have the requisite authorization
under the Insurance Ordinance to write or continue to write
the plan; or

· when taking this plan as an add-on plan of any basic plan
which has been terminated. For continuation of the cover,
you may apply to convert this add-on plan to a stand-alone
plan by giving us a written notice.

3\. We underwrite the plan and you are subject to our credit risk.
If we are unable to satisfy the financial obligations of the policy,
the insured person may lose his cover and you may lose the
remaining premium for that policy year.

4\. You are subject to exchange rate risks for plans denominated
in currencies other than the local currency. Exchange rates
fluctuate from time to time. You may suffer a loss of your benefit
values and the subsequent premium payments (if any) may
be higher than your initial premium payment as a result of
exchange rate fluctuations. You should consider the exchange
rate risks and decide whether to take such risks.

5\. The future medical costs will be higher than they are today
due to inflation. Hence, the benefit amounts and the future
premium rate of this plan may be revised to reflect the inflation.

## Premium Adjustment and Product Features Revision


### 1. Premium Adjustment

In order to provide you with continuous protection, we
will annually review and adjust the premium of your plan
accordingly at the end of policy year if necessary. During the
review, we may consider factors including but not limited to
the following:

· claim costs incurred from all policies under this plan and the
expected claim outgo in the coming year which reflects the
impact of medical trend, medical cost inflation and product
feature revisions

· historical investment returns and the future outlook of the
product's backing asset

· policy surrenders and lapses

· expenses directly related to the policy and indirect expenses
allocated to this product


### 2. Product Features Revision

We reserve the right to revise the terms and benefits upon
renewal by giving a 30 days advance notice. As long as we
maintain the registration as a VHIS provider, we guarantee you
the terms and benefits will not be less favourable than the
existing version and the latest version of the Standard Plan
terms and benefits published by the Government at the time
of renewal.

We will give you a written notice of any revision 30 days before the
end of policy year or upon renewal.

## Product Limitation

1\. We only cover the charges and / or expenses of the insured
person on medically necessary and reasonable and customary
basis.

"Medically Necessary" means the need to have medical
service for the purpose of investigating or treating the relevant
disability in accordance with the generally accepted standards
of medical practice and such medical service must:

· require the expertise of, or be referred by, a registered
medical practitioner;

· be consistent with the diagnosis and necessary for the
investigation and treatment of the disability;

· be rendered in accordance with standards of good and
prudent medical practice, and not be rendered primarily
for the convenience or the comfort of the insured person,
his family, caretaker or the attending registered medical
practitioner;

· be rendered in the setting that is most appropriate in the
circumstances and in accordance with the generally
accepted standards of medical practice for the medical
services; and

· be furnished at the most appropriate level which, in the
prudent professional judgment of the attending registered
medical practitioner, can be safely and effectively provided
to the insured person.

"Reasonable and customary" means in relation to a charge
for medical service, such level which does not exceed the
general range of charges being charged by the relevant service
providers in the locality where the charge is incurred for similar
treatment, services or supplies to individuals with similar
conditions, e.g. of the same sex and similar age, for a similar
disability, as reasonably determined by the Company in utmost
