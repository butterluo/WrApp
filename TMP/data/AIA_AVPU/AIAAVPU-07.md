You can also choose to reduce your annual deductible amount
once during the term of your policy to our specified amount
upon the policy anniversary of your policy at the age of 50, 55,
60, 65, 70, 75 or 81 of the insured person, without having to
provide us with the current details of the insured person's health
condition. The premium will increase based on your reduced
annual deductible amount, and your out-of-pocket limit for a
claim will be reduced accordingly to suit your personal needs
and affordability.
